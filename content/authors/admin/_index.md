My recent work has been in statistical genetics and ancestry estimation, including, but not limited to, optimization, cluster computing, algorithm design, and efficient experiment implementation.

I enjoy exploring the intersection between big data and computing, particularly in delivering scalable and adaptable solutions to current research questions.
