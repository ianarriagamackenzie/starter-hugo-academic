abstract: "Several studies have suggested genetic variants associated with acetaminophen induced liver injury following overdose. It is unclear if genetic variants in metabolic genes or genes associated with immune mediated liver injury (DILI) are associated with acetaminophen induced alanine aminotransferase elevation during therapeutic dosing. Acetaminophen induced ALT elevation at therapeutic doses is not associated with variants in genes associated with acetaminophen metabolism."
